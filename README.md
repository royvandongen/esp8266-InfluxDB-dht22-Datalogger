===ESP8266 InfluxDB Data logger ( DHT22 Sensor ) ===

This sketch can be used to create a data logger with a single DHT22 sensor from Adafruit.

Fill in your variables ( SSID, Password, InfluxDB server ) and you're ready to log!

Please note, NTP code is available because this is needed for some logging platforms. At this moment it is not used.
